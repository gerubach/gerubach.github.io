In this post, I'll show how to create a scatterplot of data from the palmer penguins dataset.
## Reading the data
We'll start by reading the palmer penguins data from the csv file.
```python
import pandas as pd
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
```
## Making the plot
We can make a scatterplot plotting culmen depth against culmen length.
```python
#select data to be graphed in scatterplot and delete rows with NaN
graph_data = penguins[["Culmen Length (mm)", "Culmen Depth (mm)"]]
graph_data = graph_data.dropna()

#make scatterplot of selected data with slightly transparent points
plt.scatter(graph_data["Culmen Length (mm)"], graph_data["Culmen Depth (mm)"], alpha = 0.5)

#add axis labels and a plot title
plt.xlabel("Culmen Length (mm)")
plt.ylabel("Culmen Depth (mm)")
plt.title("Penguin Culmen Depth vs Culmen Length")
```
