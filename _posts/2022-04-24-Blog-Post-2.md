title: Web Scraping Example
---

In this post I will show you how to scrape webpages. We will create a web scraper that retrieves all the TV shows and movies that Young Justice actors have starred in. For reference, here is a link to the project repository: https://github.com/rainbowschubert/imdb_scraper.

First we will create a `parse` method that navigates to the "Cast and Crew" page of Young Justice and calls `parse_full_credits`, a method that will parse the "Cast and Crew" page itself. The `parse` method is just a helper function and does not contain very significant code.

```python
def parse(self, response):
    """
    navigates to the "Cast and Crew" page of Young Justice (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1641384/fullcredits/?ref_=tt_ql_cl) and then calls parse_full_credits
    """
    yield scrapy.Request("https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1641384/fullcredits/?ref_=tt_ql_cl", self.parse_full_credits)
```

Now we must define `parse_full_credits`. On the "Cast and Crew" page, the hyperlink for each actor is next to their picture. We can get the relative paths of each actor's page using the list comprehension `[a.attrib["href"] for a in response.css("td.primary_photo a")]`. We want parse_full_credits to navigate to each actor's page, so we combine the relative path with the current url using `response.urljoin(link)` and navigate to each relative path using `scrapy.Request(response.urljoin(link), callback=self.parse_actor_page)`. We will define `parse_actor_page` in a bit.

```python
def parse_full_credits(self, response):
    """
    navigates to each Young Justice actor's page and then calls parse_actor_page
    """
    #loops through relative paths of each Young Justice actor's page
    for link in [a.attrib["href"] for a in response.css("td.primary_photo a")]:
        #add relative path to page url and navigate there. Then call parse_actor_page
        yield scrapy.Request(response.urljoin(link), callback=self.parse_actor_page)
```

Now we will use parse_actor_page to actually retrieve the TV shows and movies that each actor starred in.

```python
def parse_actor_page(self, response):
    """
    retrieves all the movies or TV shows on an actor's page and outputs 
    into an {"actor" : actor_name, "movie_or_TV_name" : movie_or_TV_name} dictionary format
    """
    #get the actor name on the page (the [:-7] deletes " - IMDb" from the end of the name)
    name = response.css("title::text").get()[:-7]

    #loop through each show linked on the actor's page under Filmography
    for item in response.css("div.filmo-row"):
        #get name of the show
        show_name = item.css("b a::text").get()

        #output dictionary containing actor name and the show they star in
        yield {
            "actor" : name,
            "movie_or_TV_name" : show_name
        }
```
And we're done! To run the scraper, simply open a command prompt, change the working directory to the directory the scraping files are in, and type `scrapy crawl imdb_scraper -o results.csv` (this will run the web crawler and output the results into results.csv). Let's see what the final table of results looks like:

Here is a bar graph of the 5 TV shows and movies with the greatest number of shared actors:
